Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that infects a computer system and restricts access to the system or files until a ransom is paid to the attacker. The ransom is usually demanded in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, as it is difficult to trace and can be easily transferred.

Ransomware typically works by encrypting the victim's files and then displaying a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The attacker may threaten to delete or destroy the encrypted data if the ransom is not paid within a certain timeframe. In some cases, the attacker may also threaten to publish sensitive data or personal information if the ransom is not paid.

Ransomware attacks can be devastating for individuals and businesses alike, as they can result in loss of important data, financial damage, and reputational harm. Prevention is key, and users can protect themselves by keeping their software up to date, using anti-malware software, avoiding suspicious emails and attachments, and maintaining regular backups of their important files.
