Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that encrypts the victim's data or restricts access to their computer system, essentially holding the data or system hostage. The attacker then demands a ransom, typically in the form of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, from the victim in exchange for restoring access or decrypting the data.

Ransomware can infect a system through various means, such as phishing emails, malicious websites, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software and networks. Once the ransomware has infiltrated the system, it begins to encrypt files or lock the computer, often displaying a message with instructions on how to pay the ransom to regain access.

Paying the ransom, however, is not a guarantee that the attacker will actually decrypt the files or restore access. In some cases, the attacker may demand additional payments or simply disappear without providing the necessary decryption keys. It is generally recommended that victims refrain from paying the ransom and instead focus on preventive measures, such as maintaining regular backups, keeping software up to date, and using security tools to protect their systems.
